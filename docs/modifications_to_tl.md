# Modifications to tl
Due to tl's complex nature, i believe it is a good idea to track what files have been modified, and for what purpose

| File that has been modified  | Why/what                                                                                          |

| lua_generator.tl             | Added sandbox options, so basically everyyhing related to transforming the code to be more secure |
